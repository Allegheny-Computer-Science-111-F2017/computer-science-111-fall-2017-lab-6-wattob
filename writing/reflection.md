# Reflection by

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. Overall, this lab
has been the most difficult. We were given a two week period to work on it
which helped a great deal. Early on, we made a lot of progress by adding
javadoc comments and the println statements. After that we added the scanner to
read in the inputs. One key thing we added was an import for the random util
which we learned has to be in alphabetical order.

Step two was difficult to understand, but eventually we realized capital letter
and lowercase letters are treated as two different things. We took advantage of
that to replace letter with their complement. Soon after we began to work on
step three, which was by far the most time consuming. We had to create a random
variableand a char for the letter being changed. An int for the insertion Index
was also made using the guide on the white board. Following that we used string
muations to represent the fragments of the strings.

After step three, we moved on to deleting a randomly chosen point, which was
much easier because we had done something similar in the step above. By
following a similar writing style we were able to randomly choose insertion
points and use more mutations for steps four and five. This lab has been
difficult, but a great learning experience.
